# The Wilds: Satisfactory

![The Wilds: Satisfactory Logo](images/TheWilds.png)

**The Wilds: Satisfactory** is a gameplay overhaul mod for Satisfactory focused on transforming the peaceful factory sim into a hostile, combat-driven survival experience. Players will face escalating waves of hostile creatures, defend their bases with automated weaponry, and adapt to an environment that actively pushes back.

## Key Features

- Expanded and intelligent creature ecosystem, including water, flying, and biome-specific threats
- Nest and boss systems that generate elite enemy waves from central regions
- AI-driven attacks targeting player infrastructure, capable of damaging and disabling buildings
- Wave mechanics tied to the day-night cycle, increasing tension and requiring preparedness
- Modular base defense systems including turrets, defensive drones, train-mounted weapons, and automated repair tools
- Multiplayer-aware difficulty scaling and multi-base support

## Project Approach & Philosophy

*The Wilds: Satisfactory* is a public mod project led by **Evil Genius Games**, developed with a commitment to transparency, collaboration, and community learning. The mod will be **open source**, allowing anyone to study, contribute to, and learn from the project. However, it will be licensed to **prevent commercial exploitation** by other entities or companies.

Evil Genius Games brings over **35 years of software development experience** to this project. While the core development will be driven in-house, we welcome collaboration from **artists, musicians, level designers**, and other interested community members. Recruitment for assistance with coding, testing, balancing, and creative content will be ongoing through open channels.

Graphics assets will utilize a mix of **licensed content** and **placeholder visuals** where necessary, particularly where original art is required. Sound effects and music may initially use temporary assets with the intent to replace them as quality resources become available.

Funding will be supported through **Patreon** and **Ko-fi** to help offset ongoing development costs. Until community support reaches a sustainable level, Evil Genius Games will cover all required expenses to keep development moving forward.

This project is being built for the enjoyment of the community, not for profit. We are committed to creating a challenging, high-quality modding experience that expands the boundaries of what Satisfactory can offer.
